BonsaiBegone
===========

A short and simple RimWorld mod that suppresses the "Bonsai tree died of rotting" message.

Requirements
==========

* [HugsLib](https://github.com/UnlimitedHugs/RimworldHugsLib) - load BonsaiBegone after HugsLib
* Ideology DLC soft requirement - it should be fine without it, but of course without the DLC there are no bonsai trees so the mod does nothing.

Installing
=========
After downloading, enable the mod in the Mods menu of the RimWorld title screen.

Steam Workshop
-------------
Subscribe to [BonsaiBegone in the Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2582637316).

Not gonna lie, setting this up was a PITA and I don't have a good guide. Regardless, pull requests welcome.
